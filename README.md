Milh (2019) [Clinical study of 19 patients with SCN8A-related epilepsy: two modes of onset regarding EEG and seizures] (under review) 

## Data

This repository contains the file SCN8A.patients.csv containing the data used for analysis concerning all patients from our cohort. 

The significations of the values used for each field are contained in the file data/codes_label.xlsx


## Analysis code

### Requirements

- [Python] code has been tested with v3.6 using anaconda distribution. 

### Rerunning analyses

You can re-run the analyses using the Python script (main_SCN8A.py).

To generate figures using the python script, execute the function main. First, you'll need to specify the path for the csv file, on the first line of the function main. You will also need to specify in which folder the figures should be saved, by setting the value of the variable 'path_results' at the beginning of the function main.
